# EbookPackageAnalysis

This is code and sample files to analyze the performance of ebook package purchases. 

Like many academic libraries, the NCSU Libraries regularly purchases large eBook front file and back file collections. Determining the performance of each collection over time is important as it will inform future decisions to update the collection. With publishers having dozens of collections, projects must be able to scale up to effectively analyze performance and value. This includes Python and R code that can be implemented to analyze the performance of ebook package purchases.
